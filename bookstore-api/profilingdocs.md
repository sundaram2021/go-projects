### Step 1: **Run CPU Profiling**

You can collect a CPU profile while running your benchmarks. Use the `-cpuprofile` flag to generate a CPU profile:

```bash
go test ./test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.out
```

This will create a file named `cpu.out` in your current directory.

### Step 2: **Run Memory Profiling**

To collect memory usage information, use the `-memprofile` flag:

```bash
go test ./test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.out
```

This will create a file named `mem.out` in your current directory.

### Step 3: **Visualize with `pprof`**

Now that you have the CPU and memory profile files, you can use Goâ€™s `pprof` tool to visualize the profiles.

#### **CPU Profile Visualization**

1. Run the following command to start `pprof` for CPU profiling:

   ```bash
   go tool pprof cpu.out
   ```

2. Inside the `pprof` interactive shell, you can use several commands to inspect the profile:

   - **`top`**: Displays the top CPU-consuming functions.
     ```bash
     (pprof) top
     ```
   
   - **`list <function-name>`**: Shows source code annotated with CPU usage for a specific function.
     ```bash
     (pprof) list <function-name>
     ```

   - **`web`**: Generates and opens a graph of the profile in a web browser.
     ```bash
     (pprof) web
     ```

     This requires `dot` from Graphviz to be installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it with:
     - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
     - **macOS**: `brew install graphviz`
     - **Windows**: Download and install Graphviz from its official site.

   - **`svg`**: Generates an SVG file with the graph of the profile.
     ```bash
     (pprof) svg
     ```

#### **Memory Profile Visualization**

To visualize memory profiling, use the following command:

1. Run the `pprof` tool for memory profiling:

   ```bash
   go tool pprof mem.out
   ```

2. Inside the interactive shell, you can use the same commands as above (`top`, `list`, `web`, `svg`) to inspect memory usage.

### Step 4: **Generate and Visualize Profile Outside of the Shell**

If you want to directly generate the profile without entering the `pprof` interactive shell, you can run:

- **Generate and open the CPU profile directly in the browser**:

   ```bash
   go tool pprof -http=":8080" cpu.out
   ```

   This command will start an HTTP server, and you can access the profile at `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. It will open a web-based interface for visualizing the profile graphically.

- **Generate and open the memory profile directly in the browser**:

   ```bash
   go tool pprof -http=":8080" mem.out
   ```

   Access it via the same URL: `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Step 5: **Analyze the Results**

1. **CPU Profile**: You can inspect which functions are consuming the most CPU time, and whether there are any bottlenecks or hotspots in your code.
2. **Memory Profile**: You can see where memory is being allocated in your application and optimize it by reducing unnecessary allocations or improving memory reuse.

These steps will give you insights into how your application is performing in terms of CPU and memory usage, and `pprof` will allow you to visualize this information effectively. Let me know if you need help with any specific part of the process!
