# Project Documentation: Platform Tools and Utilities in Go

This repository contains a collection of tools and utilities written in Go for handling various platform-related tasks, such as file operations, network programming, system monitoring, data processing, and concurrency. Each subdirectory represents a different aspect of platform handling or utility in Go.
## Features

This repository is structured into multiple subdirectories, each representing a different aspect of platform handling or utility in Go:

1. **File Handling**:
   - Provides examples and utilities for advanced file operations, including reading, writing, and manipulating file properties.

2. **Network Programming**:
   - Contains tools and examples for handling network communications, such as HTTP servers, clients, and TCP/UDP protocols.

3. **System Monitoring**:
   - Utilities to monitor system resources, gather system information, and interact with the operating system at a low level.

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Examples of how to process and manipulate data in various formats, including JSON, XML, and binary data structures.

5. **Concurrency**:
   - Demonstrates the use of Go's concurrency model, including goroutines, channels, and synchronization primitives.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine (Go 1.13 or higher recommended).
- Basic understanding of Go programming and system-level programming concepts.

### Setup and Running Examples

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone repo_url
   cd platform
   ```

2. **Explore Individual Tools/Utilities**:
   - Navigate into each directory to find specific tools or utilities.

3. **Compile and Run Specific Tools**:
   - For most Go programs, use the following commands to compile and run:
     ```sh
     go build tool_name.go
     ./tool_name
     ```
   - Replace `tool_name.go` with the actual file name of the tool you wish to compile and run.

## Technologies Used

- **Go Programming Language**: Core language used for all tools and utilities in this repository.
- **Various Go Packages**: Each tool/utility may depend on different Go packages, which are typically imported at the beginning of each Go file.

---

## Dependencies

- Specific dependencies for each tool/utility can be found in the `import` statements of each Go file.
- Common dependencies include standard library packages and possibly third-party packages for handling network protocols, file systems, etc.

## Example Tools and Their Functions

- **HTTP Server Example**:
  - Located under the `networking` directory.
  - Demonstrates how to set up a basic HTTP server in Go.

- **File Compression Utility**:
  - Found in the `file_handling` directory.
  - Shows methods to compress and decompress files using Go.

- **Concurrency Patterns**:
  - Examples located in the `concurrency` directory.
  - Demonstrates various concurrency patterns used in Go to optimize performance and safety.
