Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from all community members. To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we have established the following guidelines for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the original.

2. **Create a Branch**:
   - Once you've forked the repository, create a new branch in your fork for your contributions. Name your branch in a way that reflects the purpose of your changes, using the format: `yournamegithubusername/projecttitle`. Ensure that the `projecttitle` is relevant to the project.

## Making Changes

1. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine to start making changes:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
     cd repository-name
     git checkout -b yourname/projecttitle
     ```

2. **Create or Modify Files**:
   - If you are adding a new feature, create new files or modify existing ones. Ensure that any new files or directories you create are appropriately named to reflect their purpose and consistent with the naming conventions of the project.

3. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Make sure to write clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
     ```

## Submitting Your Changes

1. **Push Your Changes**:
   - After committing your changes locally, push them to your fork on GitHub:
     ```
     git push origin yourname/projecttitle
     ```

2. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Navigate to the original repository you forked on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your newly pushed branch. Click on "Compare & pull request" and fill out the form. Explain the changes you have made and why they are necessary.

3. **Project Folder Name**:
   - Ensure that the project folder name related to your changes is relevant and descriptive. This helps maintainers understand and organize project components effectively.

## Review Process

1. **Pull Request Review**:
   - Once you've submitted your pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes before merging your contributions. Engage in the conversation and make any required updates to your contributions.

2. **Merge**:
   - If your changes are approved, a project maintainer will merge your pull request. Congratulations, your contributions are now part of the project!

## Additional Notes

- **Stay Updated**:
  - Keep your fork synchronized with the main repository by regularly pulling in changes. This reduces the chances of conflicts:
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository-name.git
    git pull upstream main
    ```

- **Code of Conduct**:
  - Please adhere to the Github code of conduct .
